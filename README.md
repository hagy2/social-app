Social App

A **React Native + Expo** app built with **TypeScript** that fetches posts, users, and comments from the [GoRest API](https://gorest.co.in/) and displays them in a **themed mobile interface**. Each post shows the author's initials as an avatar, and tapping a post shows detailed information and comments.

This app has been **tested on the web** using **Expo Web**, ensuring it works both in browsers and mobile devices.
